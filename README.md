# DrawItOrLoseIt

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client The Gaming Room wanted to develop a multi-platform web-based version of their game Draw It or Lose It that is only available on Android. To streamline development they requested that I design and develop the environment for the web-based version of their game.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document provided a template to follow while coding the project. It provides a modular or checklist style of developing and working through a project, so it's harder to wander/get lost and waste time.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The recommendations could use more detail. I did not give enough information as why I recommended what I recommended.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were interpreted during multiple phases of the design and implementation as well. To start, I broke down the requirements of the game and it's rules to design a class diagram. I also used the memory and storage needs to make recommendations on what platforms and memory/storage management techniques to use.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I focused on clearly identifying and documenting the customer contraints and translating those to a template to follow to develop the code. In the future, I would take a closer look at customer needs and go into more detail as to why certain recommendations are being made.
